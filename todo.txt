
For 0.0.2 Preview Release
-------------------------
Make work with new wisp

podoc / readme.md
State / doc does not support extensions, protocols, frame fragmentation / continuations.

write demo app

make WebSocket const (will need to Unsafe Buf)

Check if GZIP just works!??
 - Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate


For 1.0
-------
Do binary frames (as it's now in Js API)
 - onMsg(type) or 
 - onTextMsg() / onBinaryMsg() ???

Need a WebSocksets client, with a JS native...

register ws: and wss:schemas - for WebSocketClients
 - resolve to Fantom WS client  
 
Maybe send and receive should be on a diff actor to the Actor that consumes the msgs?
  - when server sends data to the client, need a way to quickly serialise the Buf contents across Actor boundraries
 
continuation frames could be supported by supplying an OutStream rather than a Buf.
