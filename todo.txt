Ping - Pong

Do binary frames (as it's now in Js API)

Need a WebSocksets client, with a JS native...

register ws: and wss:schemas - for WebSocketClients
 - resolve to Fantom WS client  
 
Maybe send and receive should be on a diff actor to the Actor that consumes the msgs?
  - when server sends data to the client, need a way to quickly serialise the Buf contents across Actor boundraries

v1.0 does not support extensions, protocols, binary data or frame fragmentation continuations.
 
Check if GZIP just works!??
